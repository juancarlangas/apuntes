The initialization list syntax in C++ is generally considered to be the preferred way to initialize objects, especially for non-trivial objects like classes and structs. There are several reasons for this:

1. Performance: Initialization lists can often result in better performance than using the equal operator or parentheses for initialization. When you use the equal operator or parentheses, the object is first default constructed and then assigned to or copied from, which can be less efficient than initializing the object directly using an initialization list.

2. Explicitness: Initialization lists make it clear that you are initializing the object, rather than default constructing it and then assigning to it. This can help prevent mistakes and improve the readability of your code.

3. Const correctness: Initialization lists are necessary for initializing const and reference members of a class or struct. When you use the equal operator or parentheses for initialization, you cannot initialize const or reference members.

4. Order of initialization: Initialization lists allow you to control the order in which members of a class or struct are initialized. This is important because the order of initialization can affect the behavior of the program. When you use the equal operator or parentheses for initialization, the order of initialization is determined by the order of the members in the class or struct declaration.

Overall, using initialization lists is considered to be a best practice in C++ for initializing objects, especially for non-trivial objects like classes and structs. However, it's worth noting that there may be cases where using the equal operator or parentheses is more appropriate, such as for simple types or when you need to explicitly default construct an object before initializing it.

For basic types such as `int`, `double`, `char`, and so on, using the equal operator or parentheses for initialization is generally fine and may be more readable in some cases. 

For example, you can initialize an integer variable like this:

```c++
int x = 42;
```

This is a concise and clear way to initialize the integer variable `x` with the value `42`.

Similarly, you can initialize a double variable like this:

```c++
double pi = 3.14159;
```

This initializes the double variable `pi` with the value `3.14159`.

In general, the choice between using the equal operator, parentheses, or initialization lists for basic types comes down to personal preference and style. However, it's worth noting that initialization lists can be used for basic types as well, and may offer some benefits in terms of explicitness and consistency. For example:

```c++
int x{42};
double pi{3.14159};
```

This syntax initializes the `x` and `pi` variables using an initialization list, which can help make it clear that these variables are being initialized rather than default constructed and then assigned to.
