A Git commit message typically consists of three parts: a subject, a body, and a footer. The subject and the body are the mandatory parts, while the footer is optional.

Here's the recommended structure of a Git commit message:

```makefile
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

1. **Type:** The type of the commit. Examples include "feat" (for a new feature), "fix" (for a bug fix), "docs" (for documentation changes), "refactor" (for refactoring code), "test" (for adding tests), "style" (for code formatting or style changes), and so on.

2. **Scope:** The scope of the changes. This can be a specific component or module of the project that was affected by the commit.

3. **Subject:** A brief summary of the changes in the commit. The subject should be in the imperative tense and should describe what the commit does, not what it did.

4. **Body:** A more detailed description of the changes in the commit. This can include the reasoning behind the changes, any design decisions, and any relevant information about the implementation.

5. **Footer:** Additional information related to the commit, such as references to issues, pull requests, or other related commits.

It's important to write clear and concise commit messages that are easy to understand for other contributors to the project. Using a consistent and well-defined structure can help ensure that commit messages are easy to read and understand, which can be helpful for maintaining code quality and collaborating effectively on a project.

Example
-------

Here's an example of a Git commit message with the recommended structure:

```makefile
feat(user-profile): add ability to edit user profile

This commit adds a new feature that allows users to edit their profile information, including their name, email, and profile picture. The feature is accessible through a new "Edit Profile" button on the user profile page.

The implementation includes a new form component and updates to the backend API to handle the updated user information. The feature was implemented using React and Node.js, and was tested using Jest and Enzyme.

Fixes #1234
```

In this example, the commit type is "feat" (a new feature), and the scope is "user-profile" (specifically related to the user profile functionality). The subject is "add ability to edit user profile", which describes what the commit does. The body provides additional details about the changes made and the implementation details. Finally, the footer includes a reference to the issue that this commit addresses, in this case issue #1234.
